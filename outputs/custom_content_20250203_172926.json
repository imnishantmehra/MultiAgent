I know how hard that can be when we feel so limited by our humanness; we want wonderful things to happen in our lives, but we act in the opposite direction. It‚Äôs maddening! The 10 steps you‚Äôre about to discover helped me to stop acting against my own wishes and best interests and to gain the freedom , strength and courage to start living a big, blissful life.
