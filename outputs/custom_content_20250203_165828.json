I know how hard that can be when we feel so limited by our humanness; we want wonderful things to happen in our lives, but we act in the opposite direction. It‚Äôs maddening! The 10 steps you‚Äôre about to discover helped me to stop acting against my own wishes and best interests and to gain the freedom , strength and courage to start living a big, blissful life. It‚Äô s my sincere belief that these 10 steps will work for you, too. I‚Äôm a freelance writer . I‚Äôm a mother, a wife, and a small business owner. I‚Äô m recovering from living the small, uninspired life I had while I worked in high -profile positions for companies like CNBC and Discovery Communications. I had a nagging sense that there was something else waiting for me, something b igger and better that I was missing out on. Once I got clear on how to use some specific techniques from the intersection of neuroscience and psychology, a whole new world opened up to me.
